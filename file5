simply saying that git stash is used to recover a file up to the latest commit id that means if i added a file and commited a file called file6 then it will get a commit id called 890448 and if now if we deleted a file callwed file6 now and if iam not commited now and i want that file6 then we can use git stash it will check latest commit id 890448 and up to that commit id what are the file we are commited that will recover back.
